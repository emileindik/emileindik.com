      More on this later
      <!-- up until last week i did not keep a calendar. i did not even have a virtual TODO list. anything i needed to remember would be written down as a bullet point (-) on a piece of printer paper. when completed, i would draw a horizontal line through the bullet making it a plus (+). this system has worked well for me for a long time, all throughout college. in fact, i have kept most of the completed lists. interesting articles i found online would be kept in a bookmarks folder, and also referenced on the piece of printer paper as “revisit and remember”. that’s how i dealt with digital content. -->

      <!-- one of the main reasons this worked well was due to the printer paper being a single source of truth. i was able to rest easy knowing that everything i needed to remember was contained somewhere on some number of pages of printer paper. another nice thing is that it’s a pull system, not push. when in a mindset to be informed (when i needed something to do), i’d skim through the most recent pages of uncompleted bullets. contrary to having a reminder notification forcefully inject itself in to my consciousness. though, while this system has served me well for many years, it’s time i retire her.  -->
