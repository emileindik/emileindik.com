      i once had a writing experience that was truly sublime. the content was a series of anecdotes that i stream-of-conciousness, on the fly, scratched out on my phone. (it kinda spurred my writing all this shiz down). point is, iâ€™m trying to recreate the circumstances of that experience that made it so lovely. part of that involves lowering the barriers to getting words down on the page.

      i write in different tones. conversational, eloquent, formally minimalist. it'd be nice if this site picked one and stuck to it, but i'd rather not put that contraint in place. but is there a way to force myself into a given tone? let's pick conversational. that's the one i think i'm best at. but sometimes when i sit down to write my first line, something terribly formal comes out. a trick i use to cajol myself into a conversational tone is to take my first sentence and prepend it with "okay, so..."
