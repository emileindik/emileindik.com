      <b>what do i think i'm doing</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      i'm polishing and publishing. while likely irrelevant or uninteresting, each of these thoughts gave me pause. each crossed an arbitrary significance threshold, enough so to motivate me to crytalize them in this .html file.

      i want to catch a spark and coax it to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      often, an idea is a spark that comes to life then quickly flickers out. it exists for a fraction of a second, hardly enough time to examine or give it any thought. the spark vanishes leaving no trace besides the inkling of some idea having occurred. i’d estimate 80-90% of all ideas i have are of this form.
    </p>

    <p>
      writing the idea down helps. it really does. even still, the above phenomenon shows in my writing--jumpy, nonsequeters everywhere, fragments of an idea begging to be properly fleshed out.

    <p>
      i’ve found it much easier to maintain a linear train of thought when i write stories, anecdotes. a key property of the anecdote is that its beginning, middle, and end is already known.
    </p>

    <p>
      i guess now i understand why teachers extoll the virtues of <i>outlining</i>. besides the structural benefits, it suddenly becomes easier to flow when you know where you're going.

      i want set my highway back 100 years to a cobblestone road.
    </p>
    <p>
      my mind's idea pipeline is currently a highway, think autobahn. i want to take a jackhammer to it and convert the pipeline into a cobblestone road, or maybe a dusty gravel path, i'm not sure which imagery i prefer. ideas travel fast down my highway, and are liable to zip right off the edge. if i could just slow things down, install some speed bumps, perhaps i could get to know my ideas a bit better before they're gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      i think that writing will improve the stickiness of my brain, allowing ideas to sit and stew before being released.

      okay, so i can capture the spark. blow into it. coax it into something living. and talk to it as it travels down my bumpy road.

      also, maybe i'll finally learn the proper use of a dash.
