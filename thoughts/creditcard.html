      <b>Credit card arbitrage</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      I recently signed up for Fidelity’s Visa Signature rewards card. It offers 2% unlimited cashback. Not bad. I started thinking about what kind of hanky panky I could pull with it. Here’s the play:
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use Fidelity Visa Signature to buy a $500 prepaid visa debit card for $505.95.
          <br> 
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanillagift.com/catalog?type=email_animated"><img src="../static/assets/prepaidcard.png" alt="Prepaid visa debit card" width="50%"></a>

        </li>
        <li>
          Link your new debit card to your Venmo account and pull the full $500 into your Venmo account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the $500 from Venmo to your checking account. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Receive $10 in cashback the next month for a profit of $4.05.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

      Besides the credit card, this highly sophisticated quant strategy has one prerequisite, a Venmo debit card. It is only possible to fund your Venmo account with cash after having been <a target="_blank" href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012932154-Adding-Money-to-Your-Venmo-Balance">approved for their debit card</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      Closing remarks
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visa sells other denominations of prepaid card but the $500 option yields the best return.
        </li>

        <li>
          I considered using reloadable cards but found they cannot be reloaded via credit card. However, they do have a lower upfront cost ($1-$3). If the initial load can be paid for with credit card and the various fees charged for maintaining the account can be avoided, this direction would be worth investigating more.
        </li>

        <li>
          This strategy can be executed multiple times a day. The first limit you might run up against is your credit limit, but that can usually be increased upon request.
        </li>

          Reach out to me if you try this or think of any improvements.
