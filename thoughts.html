    some things i've been thinking about -- the idea is to eventually flesh these out:
    <br>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <b>self imposed constraints when creating</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>why writing can help you catch a spark and coax it to life</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>why writing can clarify your priorities</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>cooking your own food downgrades productivity</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>diplomacy</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>why putting content on a public forum is productive</b>
    <br>
    most of my creative efforts are spent on projects that never see the light of day. however, there is much to learn from having a project live in a public domain. to glean any insights offered, one can start a very small project, polish it, and publish it. much like this here site.
