    some things i've been thinking about -- the idea is to eventually flesh these out:

        <b>self imposed constraints when creating</b>

        <b>why writing can help you catch a spark and coax it to life</b>
      </p>

    <div>
      <p>
        <b>why writing can clarify your priorities</b>

        <b>cooking your own food downgrades productivity</b>

        <b>why putting content on a public forum is productive</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        most of my creative efforts are spent on projects that never see the light of day. however, there is much to learn from having a project live in a public domain. to glean any insights offered, one can start a very small project, polish it, and publish it. much like this here site.

      <p>
        <b>digital brain set cover: events, notes, tasks</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <div>
      <p>
        <b>keep it brief</b>
        <br>
        ignore any fluff found below:
      </p>
      <p>
        so i'm <i>surfing the net</i> and come across an interesting sounding article. before opening it, i experience some suspense about the length of the upcoming commitment. if the article turns out to be lengthy, i sigh and get comfortable. the title that drew me in was one that promised great knowledge, and now it's up to me to find the ring in the rubble.
      </p>
      <p>
        if the article is short, i'm over the moon. the knowledge i seek is presented plainly before me. no fluff to scrape away, no word search to solve. efficient as it is, brevity doesn't happen often -- articles seem to use a lot of words these days.
      </p>
      <p>
        i remember somewhere saying that i endevour to use writing as an exploratory tool, a way to flesh out thoughts and to meander around the bends in my peabrain. and i'm realizing this ambition seems to contradict my whole <i>keep it brief</i> spiel. for now, i think the best way forward is to be very intentional about which style i'm going for. default to brevity. otherwise, if there are hidden pockets of insight that need unearthing, at least warn the audience about the impending wall of text.
